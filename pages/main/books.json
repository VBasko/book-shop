    "description": "Le Père Goriot, (French: “Father Goriot”) novel by Honoré de Balzac, originally published in French in the Revue de Paris in 1834 and published in book form in 1835. The novel is considered one of the best works of Balzac’s panoramic series La Comédie humaine (“The Human Comedy”), and it was the first to feature characters that would reappear in later novels. This pessimistic case study of bourgeois society’s ills after the French Revolution tells the intertwined stories of Eugène de Rastignac, an ambitious but penniless young man, and old Goriot, a father who sacrifices everything for his children."
